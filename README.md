####                                      PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project is based on detecting and predicting the position (stance) of a news headline with respect to its summary. This is to reduce the amount of fake news being circulated. News headlines are supposed to be in synchrony with the news summary, but due to some factors like politics etc this is usually not so. 

 This  project is aimed at predicting the position of the headlines- agree, disagree, discuss or unrelated, with respect  to the summarized news. It is actually a competition, which I may be participating in the near future. 

The dataset contains the news headline column and the stance (position) column. It is a typical text classification/Natural Language Processing problem
